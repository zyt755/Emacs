* Spacemacs Rocks Season2 (Day 4)

** Talk more about load, load-file, require, provide and auto-laod

** Better defaults

   1. Indent-region or buffer

      #+BEGIN_SRC 

      
      #+END_SRC

** Dired mode and file related oeprations
1. copy, delete and rename file
   Copy/Delete/Rename files and folders


#+BEGIN_SRC 

;; dired -reuse current buffer by press 'a'
(put ' dired-find-alternate-file 'disabled nil)

;; always delete and copy recursively
(setq dired-recursive-deletes ' always)
(setq dired-recursive-copies ' always)

;; if there is a dired buffer displayed in the next window, use its current subdir, instead of current
   subdir of this dired buffer
(setq dired-dwim-target t)

(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "RET") ' dired-find-alternate-file)

;; less typing when Emacs ask you yes or no
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

#+END_SRC
   +: to create diretory
   C-x C-f: to open/create a file
   g: to refresh dired buffer
   C: copy file
   d: delete file

2. add new file and folder

   +: add a new folder
   C-x C-f to create a new file.

3. open dired of current buffer
C-c d
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(require ' dired-x)

#+END_SRC

after applying this setting, we could press 'C-x C-j' to jump to the dired buffer of current file


4. open finder on Mac. (optional)
   
   Packages :
   
   reveal-in-osx-finder for openning the finder of the current file
