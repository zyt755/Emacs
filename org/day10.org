  Topic: Company-mode and auto-completition

  Cask and macro/use-package

** Fix previous issues

** how company-mode 
   
   1. backend for the completion sources and front end to display the condidates

      2. C-h v company-backends
	 
	 C-h v C-h f 

	 h = help

	 3. try company-file and company-ispell, M-x
	    
	    company-ispell helps you spell the word if you do not remember

	    company-file helps you to find the file

	    4. C-h C-f to view the backend implementation


** Why my company sucks?
   
   1. Python anaconda-mode not works

      2. Some backends require build with a server-client architecture: company-anaconda(company python), company-jedi(company python, but not as good as anaconda), company-ycmd(c++), company-tern(js) etc

	 3. At first, you should make sure the server side is working properly and then you want to make sure you use the right backend
	    
	    4. how to fix anaconda on Mac
	       
	       make sure that company-anaconda, company-ycmd is in front of company-dabbrev. If company-dabbrec is before anaconda, they will not work.
	       
	       e.g. 

	       #+BEGIN_SRC

(add-hook ' python-mode-hook
lambda()
(set (make-local-variable ' company-backends) ' ((company-anaconda company-dabbrev-code) company-dabbrev)))

	       
	       #+END_SRC
	       
	       #+BEGIN_SRC 

(setq tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options 
"-o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPath='tramp.%%C' -o ControlPersist=no")
	       
	       #+END_SRC

** Groups backend
   
** Write a Simple company backend
